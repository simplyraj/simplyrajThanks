Hello, I’m Raj.

I’m a general management leader with extensive sales, strategy, operations, finance and organizational leadership experience.

This is my personal website, where I write about business strategy, markets and technology.

I'm currently part of the sales and go-to-market (GTM) leadership team at [Equinix](http://www.equinix.com), focused on Strategic Alliances, Business Development, Sales & GTM. Before Equinix, I spent many years in corporate finance at [JP Morgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) and [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/), and as a portfolio manager for a boutique quantitative investment firm.

I hold a MBA from [Cornell University](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), a MS in mechanical engineering from [University of Maryland, College Park](https://enme.umd.edu/), dual degrees in engineering (B.Tech and M.Tech) from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), India. I have also completed leadership and executive education programs at [Harvard Business School](https://www.exed.hbs.edu/) and [Wharton](https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/).

I live in Silicon Valley.

I have diverse and deep interests across many domains (finance, investment, history, sales, science, technology, humor, philosophy, travel, culture). The breadth and depth of my experience and interests provides me great perspective in being an effective leader.
